### Aim of the experiment
1 - To adjust reaction conditions (pressure, temperature, concentration) to shift equilibrium toward maximum product yield.

2 - To counteract external changes and maintain system equilibrium efficiently in chemical processes.

3 - To optimize industrial reactions (like ammonia synthesis) by applying equilibrium principles for better efficiency and output.
