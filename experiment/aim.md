### Aim of the experiment
  
To adjust reaction conditions to shift equilibrium for maximum product yield, maintain system equilibrium efficiently, and optimize industrial reactions using equilibrium principles.

1. Shifting Equilibrium Toward Product Formation
Adjusting pressure, temperature, and concentration to favor product yield.

2. Maintaining Chemical Equilibrium
Counteracting external changes to keep the system balanced.

3. Optimizing Industrial Processes
Applying equilibrium concepts to enhance efficiency in large-scale reactions like ammonia synthesis.
