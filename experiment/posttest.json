      "question": "In metallic nanowires, electrical conductivity typically:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Decreases at small sizes due to electron scattering",
        "b": "Increases at small sizes",
        "c": "Remains constant regardless of size",
        "d": "Becomes zero"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "At very small sizes, electron scattering at surfaces and boundaries increases, leading to reduced electrical conductivity.",
        "b": "Electrical conductivity usually decreases, not increases.",
        "c": "Conductivity changes with size due to scattering effects.",
        "d": "Conductivity does not drop to zero solely because of size."

      "question": "Why do magnetic nanoparticles exhibit superparamagnetism at small sizes?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The spins align perfectly at all sizes",
        "b": "The material is always in a magnetic state",
        "c": "Thermal fluctuations cause random alignment of spins",
        "d": "Electron scattering leads to ferromagnetism"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Spins do not align perfectly at all sizes, especially small ones.",
        "b": "Magnetic state can fluctuate at nanoscale.",
        "c": "Thermal energy is enough to randomly orient magnetic moments, causing superparamagnetism.",
        "d": "Electron scattering does not cause ferromagnetism in this context."

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Density is not the key factor.",
        "b": "Atomic number remains the same for an element.",
        "c": "High surface area to volume ratio provides more reactive sites.",
        "d": "Lattice energy may influence properties but is less direct."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Classical mechanics generally predicts linear or smooth changes.",
        "b": "Surface impurities affect properties but are not the main cause of non-linearity.",
        "c": "Quantum size effects cause distinct non-linear behavior at nanoscale.",
        "d": "Atomic spacing changes with size and affects properties."

      "question": "Which property becomes dominant in nanoparticles but is negligible in bulk materials?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Volume",
        "b": "Surface properties",
        "c": "Atomic weight",

        "a": "Volume is dominant in bulk materials, not nanoparticles.",
        "b": "Surface properties dominate at the nanoscale due to increased surface area.",
        "c": "Atomic weight is constant and not size-dependent.",
        "d": "Gravitational interaction is negligible at this scale."
