      "question": "Which of the following is the primary reason for changes in electronic properties of nanomaterials at small sizes?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Surface corrosion",
        "b": "Quantum confinement",
        "c": "Thermal expansion",
        "d": "Chemical doping"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Surface effects exist but quantum confinement dominates at small scales.",
        "b": "Quantum confinement causes discrete energy levels, altering electronic properties.",
        "c": "Thermal expansion is not the main factor here.",
        "d": "Chemical doping changes properties, but this question refers to size effects."

      "question": "What happens to the melting point of nanoparticles as their size decreases?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It increases",
        "b": "It becomes infinite",
        "c": "It remains unchanged",
        "d": "It decreases"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Smaller particles don’t have higher melting points.",
        "b": "Infinite melting points are not realistic.",
        "c": "Melting points change with size.",
        "d": "Decreased size leads to lower melting points due to surface effects."

      "question": "Why are nanomaterials often more chemically reactive than bulk materials?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "More impurities",
        "b": "Lower energy levels",
        "c": "Higher surface area to volume ratio",
        "d": "Smaller atomic radii"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "It’s not mainly about impurities.",
        "b": "Energy levels are influenced but not the key reason.",
        "c": "Higher surface area means more active sites for reactions.",
        "d": "Atomic radii stay roughly the same."

      "question": "As the size of a semiconductor nanoparticle decreases, the band gap energy typically:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Decreases",
        "b": "Remains constant",
        "c": "Increases",
        "d": "Becomes negative"

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Band gap increases, not decreases, with smaller size.",
        "b": "It does not stay constant.",
        "c": "Smaller size leads to larger band gaps due to quantum effects.",
        "d": "Negative band gaps are not physical."
